# Wolfbeat
Wolfbeat will hopefully evolve into a modern music player.
I plan to design a brilliant user interface that can be customised in most ways, this means that you can customise most components on the application.

The main purpose of this application is for experience and personal development. I hope I can learn a few things doing this project.
